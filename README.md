I analysis the data for New York. However, the result shows a negetive effect of rating on sales (rd_estimate = -1.545 <0). The reasons for this result may be some confounding problems or the estimate of sales. I also tried Boston and Amsterdam. The data for Boston is more dense clsoe to the threshold. And there are few data near the threshold for Amsterdam.
