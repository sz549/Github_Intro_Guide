Eventually here is my result

Due to a net-work failure, I can't upload theose origin csv files via lfs right now, although it's already installed. Instead, I leave a link to my google drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kdYDhc2F0JR6kVUvy4NHXI950gaorWNx?usp=sharing, which contains all the origin files used in the code. 

Comments added here: the readme file is a guidance how other collaborates could execute your code and get your result. So 
please follow the readme file in the `main` branch and add more details.

Update Nov.16:

For replication on your computer locally, plz follow the following steps:
1. download folder from the link to my google drive;
2. open .pynb (Jupyter notebook is adviced);
3. In the third code box, change the variable 'directory' to the directory where you store the folder;
4. RUN MY CODE FOR ONLY THE THIRD & FIFTH CODE BOX (Omitt those code box with 'google');
5. YOU GET THE RESULT!

If you prefer colab as well as me, click the BRIGHT YELLOW BOTTON with on the file and you know what to do.
